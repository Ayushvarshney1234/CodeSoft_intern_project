        <h2>About Chandra Shekhar Azad</h2>
        <p>
            In the princely state of Alirajpur, Chandra Shekhar Tiwari, popularly known as Chandra Shekhar Azad, was born on 23 July 1906 in the hamlet of Bhabhra. When the Non-Cooperation Movement was at its zenith in 1921, Chandra Shekhar, a scholar, joined the movement at the young age of 15 years. He was, thus, taken into custody on 20 December the same year. A week later, while being summoned before the Parsi District Magistrate by Justice M. P. Khareghat he declared his title as "Azad" (The Free), his father's name as "Swatantrata" (Independence), and his place of abode as "Jail."<br>

Azad was dissatisfied when Mahatma Gandhi decided to put an end to the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1922. He met Ram Prasad Bismil, who had founded the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), a revolutionary organisation, through a young revolutionary named Man Nath Gupta. Chandra Shekhar Azad then joined the HRA actively and began to raise money for the HRA. Robberies targeting the government buildings accounted for majority of the collected funds. In order to take revenge for Lala Lajpat Rai's murder, Chandra Shekhar Azad took part in the Kakori Train Robbery in 1925, the shooting of John P. Saunders in Lahore in 1928, and finally in the attempt to attack the Viceroy of India's train in 1929.<br>

In order to accomplish the objective of an independent India based on socialist principles, Azad clandestinely restructured the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) in 1928 alongside Bhagat Singh and other rebels, renaming it as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) on 8 September.<br>

Azad scheduled a meeting with another revolutionary in the Alfred Park in Allahabad on 27 February 1931 (now known as the Azad Park). The police surrounded him as soon as he arrived at the park. Two police officers were injured during the ensuing gunfight, and Chandra Shekhar Azad is said to have shot himself in the head with the last bullet from his weapon.<br>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Jawaharlal Nehru in his autobiography wrote that Azad met him a few weeks before his death, inquiring about the possibility of not being considered an outlaw as a result of Gandhi-Irwin pact. Nehru wrote that Azad also saw the 'futility' of his methods and so did many of his associates, though was not completely convinced that 'peaceful methods' would work either.<br>
            The 2018 television series Chandrashekhar chronicled the life of Azad from his childhood to his being a revolutionary leader. In the series, young Azad was portrayed by Ayaan Zubair, Azad in his teens by Dev Joshi and the adult Azad by Karan Sharma.<br>
            In 2023 DD National serial Swaraj included a full episode on Chandra Shekar Azad. The title role of Chandra Shekar Azad was played by actor Manish Naggdev.<br>
            Chandra Shekhar Azad's sacrifice and courage continue to inspire the nation. His life remains a testament to the indomitable spirit of India's freedom fighters.<br>
